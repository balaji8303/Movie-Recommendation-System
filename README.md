# Movie Recommendation System

## About

The **Movie Recommendation System** is a Python-based project designed to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences. Users can filter movies by IMDb rating, director name, and genre. The project incorporates design patterns like Facade, Decorator, and Strategy, ensuring clean, extendable, and maintainable code. Additionally, it uses a JSON file as the data source, and plans are in place to integrate APIs for fetching and updating movie data dynamically.

## Features

- **Filter by IMDb Rating**: Find movies with ratings above a specified threshold.
- **Filter by Genre**: Browse movies of your preferred genres.
- **Filter by Director**: Discover movies directed by your favorite filmmakers.
- **Expandable Design**: Leverages design patterns (Facade, Decorator, Strategy) for easy extensibility.
